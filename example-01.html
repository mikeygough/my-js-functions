		// A function in JS is written like this:
		function hello() {

		// Open this page in the browser. Notice the text does not

		// Call a function by writing it's name and following the name

		// Functions are useful because the code they contain can be run 
		// as many times as needed. Uncomment the lines below: 

		hello()
		hello()
		hello()
		hello()
		hello()

		// heck why not make a loop! Try this:

		for (let i = 0; i < 100; i += 1) {
			hello()
		}

		// Above you called the hello function 100 times! But you 
		// only wrote a single line of code. Pretty effecient!
